# Implementation

- We generate random permutations of the letters in the set "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvxz"
- Present prompt the user by displaying an exclemation mark as a ready signal
- Display a random permutation in a sequence
- Ask the user to input the letters in the sequence
- - Here order doesn't matter, but we will be keeping track of which positions the user had the easiest time remembering
- Generate a plot with the letter positions on the x-axis and the mean accuracy on the y-axis.
